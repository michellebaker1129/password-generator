# Password Generator


## For when you want a random but personalized password

Do you need a new password but can't be bothered to think one up on your own? Look no further!  


## Let's talk details
 As a soon-to-be employed person, I will have access to all sorts of sensitive data. I will want to quickly generate passwords that meet the security requirements of the company.

When the time comes, I will be able to visit this website on a moment's notice.
When I click on this button to generate a new password, I will be prompted to chose what character types to include in the new password.
Once I have selected lower case, upper case, numeric and/or special characters, I will be able to enter the desired length of my password.
As long as I choose between 8 and 128 characters, my new password will generate!
Then I will be able to copy and paste to my heart's content. 

I learned some new tricks to create this project! 
Among other things:
- I practiced using pseudo code to organize my work and ensure all the acceptance criteria was met. 
- I built the right variables to begin with (whew!).
- I altered the order of prompts to the user for a better user experience, while ensuring that the original acceptance criteria is preserved.
- I learned about error handling in javascript, and how to test my work and fix what broke before moving on.
- I constructed my first official for loop to generate my new password.
